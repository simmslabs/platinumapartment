## API Integration

### Payment Methods Enum Usage
```typescript
import { PaymentMethod } from "@prisma/client";

// Create payment
const payment = await prisma.payment.create({
  data: {
    method: PaymentMethod.CREDIT_CARD,
    status: PaymentStatus.COMPLETED,
    // ... other fields
  }
});
```

### Querying Payment Data
```typescript
// Get all payments by method
const creditCardPayments = await prisma.payment.findMany({
  where: { method: "CREDIT_CARD" },
  include: { booking: { include: { user: true } } }
});

// Get payment statistics
const stats = await prisma.payment.groupBy({
  by: ['method', 'status'],
  _count: { id: true },
  _sum: { amount: true }
});
```

## Frontend Integration

Payment methods can be displayed in forms:

```tsx
const paymentMethods = [
  { value: "CASH", label: "Cash" },
  { value: "CREDIT_CARD", label: "Credit Card" },
  { value: "DEBIT_CARD", label: "Debit Card" },
  { value: "ONLINE", label: "Online Payment" },
  { value: "BANK_TRANSFER", label: "Bank Transfer" },
];
```

## Security Considerations

- **Payment Data**: All payment records include transaction IDs
- **PCI Compliance**: No actual card numbers stored
- **Audit Trail**: Complete payment history tracking
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data properly protected

## Future Enhancements

- **Partial Payments**: Support for payment installments
- **Refund Processing**: Automated refund workflows
- **Payment Webhooks**: Real-time payment status updates
- **Multi-Currency**: Support for different currencies
- **Payment Analytics**: Advanced reporting and insights

This seeding provides a solid foundation for testing and developing payment-related features in the apartment management system.
